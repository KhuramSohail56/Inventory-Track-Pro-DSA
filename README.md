# 📦 Inventory Track Pro

**Inventory Track Pro** is a high-performance inventory management system developed in **C++**. This project demonstrates the practical application of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to solve real-world resource tracking and data management challenges.

---

## 🛠️ Data Structures & Logic
This system is built for efficiency, utilizing advanced structures to ensure fast data processing:

* **Hash Table (Chaining):** Implemented for **O(1)** average time complexity during product lookups by ID.
* **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Used for efficient **Range Searching** of products based on price points.
* **Stacks (Undo/Redo):** A dual-stack architecture to manage system states, allowing users to revert or repeat actions.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Comparison between **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** for organizing inventory by price, rating, or sales performance.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **Persistent Storage:** Full support for saving and loading inventory data via `.txt` files.
* **Input Validation:** Robust error handling to prevent invalid data types or out-of-range entries.
* **Data Analytics:** Capability to sort and filter products based on sales trends and user ratings.
