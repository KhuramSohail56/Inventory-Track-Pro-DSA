Inventory Track Pro 🚀
Inventory Track Pro is a high-performance inventory management system developed in C++. This project was designed to demonstrate the efficient implementation of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to solve real-world resource tracking problems.

🛠️ Data Structures Implemented
This project goes beyond simple CRUD operations by utilizing advanced data structures for efficiency:

Hash Table (Chaining): Optimized for O(1) average time complexity during product lookups by ID.

Binary Search Tree (BST): Used for efficient Range Searching of products based on price points.

Stacks (Undo/Redo): A dual-stack architecture to manage system states and allow users to revert or repeat actions.

Sorting Algorithms: Comparison between Merge Sort and Quick Sort for organizing inventory by price, rating, or sales.

✨ Key Features
Persistent Storage: Save and load inventory data via .txt files.

Input Validation: Robust error handling for data types and price/rating ranges.

Analytics: Sort products by performance metrics like sales and ratings.
